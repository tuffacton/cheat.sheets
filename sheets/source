# This is a shell builtin available in bash, but not in the Bourne Shell (`sh`).
# The contents of FILE (assuming shell script) will be sourced into the current
# session, allowing external use of things like its functions and variables.
source FILE
# The above can be written in short-hand, for the same effect:
. FILE

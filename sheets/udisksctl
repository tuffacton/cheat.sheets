# Mount partition on the given block device. This will by default use '/media', and
# on typical systems won't even require root privileges.
udisksctl mount -b /dev/sd??

# Set up a loop device using 'imagefile'. This only sets it up, so you will
# probably also want to mount it thereafter, using the device given to you after
# executing this command. often, if not always, this is '/dev/loopX', where X is
# the loop device number.
udisksctl loop-setup -f image file

# Like the above, except this will delete the loop device (assuming 'loop0' was
# previously created) but note that this will NOT delete the image file. Be sure to
# unmount the filesystem(s) on the device first, before deleting it.
udisksctl loop-delete -b /dev/loop0

# Power off a block device. May not work for all devices, and may vary in effect.
udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdb

# Find all file names ending with .pdf and remove them
find -name \*.pdf | xargs rm
# The above, however, is preferable written without xargs:
find -name \*.pdf -exec rm {} \+
# Or, for find's own functionality, it's best as:
find -name \*.pdf -delete

# Find all file name ending with .pdf and remove them
# (bulletproof version: handles filenames with \n and skips *.pdf directories)
# -r = --no-run-if-empty
# -n10 = group by 10 files
find -name \*.pdf -type f -print0 | xargs -0rn10 rm

# If file name contains spaces you should use this instead
find -name \*.pdf | xargs -I{} rm -rf '{}'

# Will show every .pdf like:
#	&toto.pdf=
#	&titi.pdf=
# -n1 => One file by one file. ( -n2 => 2 files by 2 files )
find -name \*.pdf | xargs -I{} -n1 echo '&{}='
# The above is, however, much faster and easier without xargs:
find -name \*.pdf -printf "%p\n"

# Group words by three in a string
seq 1 10 | xargs -n3

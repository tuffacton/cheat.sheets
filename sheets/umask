# Unless configured otherwise, this will set the umask ("user mask" or "file mode
# creation mask") for only the current user, and only his or her current session.
# The (one) leading zero is optional, unless you otherwise need it.
#
# This umask setting is actually recommended for security by RHEL, and is also
# mentioned and I believe recommended in the Arch Linux Wiki.

# The result of '0077' being -- and I'll use standard octal with which we're all
# probably familiar -- that all new files are created using the '600'
# permissions, and directories are '700'.
#
# Remember, the standard format means 4=read, 2=write, and 1=execute. However, the
# umask uses the same, but is inverted, so a umask of '077' would be 700, and
# correctly lowers to 600 when it's just a file.
umask 0077

# Akin to above, but instead, output the current umask setting.
